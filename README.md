# Open-source-comments

Table for comparison of existing open-source self-hosted commenting servers
(https://lisakov.com/projects/open-source-comments/).

Data are stored in `data.yaml`.
`yml2js.py` converts `YAML` to `js`-arrays to be used by
[datatables.js](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables).

# TODO

- Script to parse amount of github stars and write to `data.yaml`

- Simplify and improve `py` code

# Contribution

Any contribution on adding commenting system other information are welcome.
Please fork the repository and push changes to the `data.yaml` file. Want
another column? Let me know by sumbitting an issue.
