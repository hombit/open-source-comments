# Open-source-comments

A table of open-source self-hosted commenting servers
(https://lisakov.com/projects/open-source-comments/)
to make the choice easier.

The data are stored in `data.yaml`.
`yml2js.py` converts `YAML` to `js`-arrays so it can be loaded to
[datatables.js](https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables).

# TODO

- Foremost: check/add the information to make the table useful.

- Script to parse amount of github stars and write to `data.yaml`. See
  [github-stars](https://github.com/stretchr/github-stars).

- Simplify and improve python code.

# Contribution

Any contribution on adding commenting system other information are welcome.
Please fork the repository and push changes to the `data.yaml` file. Want
another column? Let me know by submitting an issue.
