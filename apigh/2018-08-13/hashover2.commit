      "patch": "@@ -1,5 +1,57 @@\n Changes by Jacob Barkdull 2017-08-09\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+* Frontend settings have returned!\n+\n+  HashOver 1.0 had limited frontend control over settings, like how tall the\n+  comment box is and which fields are enabled. For technical reasons this\n+  feature was removed early in development of HashOver 2.0.\n+\n+  This feature is now back and better than ever.\n+\n+  You now have much greater frontend control over settings, limited to settings\n+  that are safe to expose to the public, meaning you can't change the\n+  notification e-mail address from the frontend, for example, but most settings\n+  are available to change from the frontend.\n+\n+  To use this new feature you need to do the following...\n+\n+    1. Use the new `hashover/loader.php` script instead of the\n+       `hashover/comments.php` script.\n+\n+    2. You need to use the `?nodefault` URL query. Please keep in mind that this\n+       query name might change before official release.\n+\n+       The resulting script tag should look something like this:\n+\n+         <script src=\"/hashover/loader.php?nodefault\"></script>\n+\n+    3. In another script you will need to instantiate HashOver manually, in\n+       doing so you may specify the URL, title, thread, and settings.\n+\n+       Like so:\n+\n+         var hashover = new HashOver ({\n+             url: 'http://example.com/cool-blog-post',\n+             title: 'Example Title of My Cool Blog Post',\n+\n+             settings: {\n+                 allowsImages: false,\n+                 formPosition: 'bottom',\n+\n+                 fieldOptions: {\n+                     password: false,\n+                     email: false\n+                 }\n+             }\n+         });\n+\n+       The code above disables embedded external images, changes the form\n+       position to be on the bottom of the comment thread, and disables the\n+       password and e-mail fields. You may also: require a field, change the\n+       theme, change the language, collapse the comments, and much more!\n+\n+       Enjoy! As always, improvements are welcome!\n+\n * Fixed: Posting a comment with required fields always threw an exception.\n * Fixed: Page reload when editing a comment when the e-mail field is disabled.\n * Fixed: The public `$imageFormat` setting was not being respected."
