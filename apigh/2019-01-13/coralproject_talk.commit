Depending on the desired configuration the roles can be split up to ensure high availability, and best matching to underlying host resources. \n+\n+There are three components to the Talk application that can be served independently or in combination on a single thread: API Server, WebSockets, and Jobs\n+\n+![ServerArchitectureDiagram](/talk/images/ServerArch.png)\n+\n+In the diagram we see the difference between a Typical configuration (which just adds additional Talk application instances) vs the Split configuration where different Talk components could be spread across different machine resources to optimize infrastructure utilization. \n+See [Serving the Application](/talk/configuration-cli-tools/#serving-the-application)\n+\n+### Scaling Redis\n+\n+Redis serves as a general cache and pub/sub broker. We treat all the data stored in Redis as ephemeral, so using as a cache serves us well for Talk to synchronize expensive query caches. It also serves as our pub/sub broker for use with live updates as propagated through the GraphQL subscription system. For this reason it is not recommended to implement multiple instances of Redis. \n+\n+### Scaling MongoDB\n+\n+MongoDB is treated as our general store for persisted data. Talk supports the most common strategies for scaling MongoDB instances including replicas and/or sharding. Depending on your specific data use cases, refer to MongoDBs documentation for more information about scaling https://www.mongodb.com/mongodb-scale.\n+\n+### Load Balancer \n+While this subject lives outside the Talk ecosystem, it is critical for application delivery. For websockets to work correctly, a load balancer must be selected that can support long lived connections that are required for websockets to work.\n+\n+## Running Talk in Production\n+\n+When you are ready to launch your production instance of Talk update your NODE_ENV environment variable from `development` to `production` mode.\n+\n+Then launch talk with `yarn start` or with the command `NODE_ENV=production ./bin/cli-serve -j -w`\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+"
