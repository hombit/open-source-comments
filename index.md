# Open-source self-hosted comments for a static website

This comparison table is inspired by
[staticsitegenerators.net](http://staticsitegenerators.net/). Contribute at
[github](https://github.com/pozitron57/open-source-comments) —
add the missing data. Github-related data (stars, open issues + PR, etc.)
are updated daily automatically. Want different columns? Noted a bug? Submit

## What’s wrong with Disqus

Disqus loads absurd amount of tracking services, which exposes your visitors’
personal data and significantly increases loading time. See, e.g., 
[this post](http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#what-s-wrong-with-disqus).

## What’s not covered here

For a static website, one usually wants a lightweight commenting server with
as little dependencies as possible. Few commenting engines listed on the page
are provided by heavy applications (e.g.,
[discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse),
[talkyard](https://github.com/debiki/talkyard)), but the majority are
relatively lightweight applications designed specifically to provide 
comments for the static pages.

This page prioritizes information on self-hosted comments. However, there
are other open-source solutions, including implementations of third-party
services (e.g., Github issues, such as
[[1]](https://github.com/imsun/gitment),
[[2]](https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk),
[[3]](https://github.com/Blankj/awesome-comment),
[[4]](https://github.com/utterance/utterances)).

## Share your experience

Please share your experience if you are using one of the commenting systems
listed in the table. Write a short summary and provide your "Likes" and
"Dislikes" to help other users to decide which commenting system suit them
best. If you are going to post the first opinion on a commenting system,
please set your name to the name of this commenting system. All the other
